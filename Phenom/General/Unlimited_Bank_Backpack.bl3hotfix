###
### Modify the base backpack space to unlimited.
### Modify the bank SDU Lv1 to unlimited.
###
### The unlimited space also reduce the lags in huge inventories.
###
### Known issue:
### The Unlimited BANK space DOES NOT WORK in Arm's Race, you can't retrieve your gears because the game see a negative space.
### To fix it, you can temporarily modify it from -1000 to a positive value depending on your stuff in bank.
### The lesser the better because the game loads every slots even the empties ones.
### For example if you have 100 items in your bank, put something like 150 or less.
### Then either restart your game or go back to the main logo page to reload the hotfixes before starting an Arm's Race.
